Using Python 3.6
setup: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
PyOpenGL and Numpy available as wheels here:
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl
A known issue with PyOpenGL means that the wheel is required rather than the normal pip package.
"pip install wheel"
"python -m wheel install <wheel_file>.whl"
